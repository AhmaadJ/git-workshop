# Git Workshop

This is a quick demo on basic git usage.

# Why Git?

When you have a big project, people end up with different versions and it
is hard to maintain concurrently.

People had ideas - SVN and CVS, but Linus was unhappy... so he disappeared
for 2 weeks and came back with `git`.

# How Git?

## Installing:

Windows:

https://desktop.github.com/

Mac:

Check if you have it by running `git --version` on a terminal.

http://git-scm.com/download/mac if not or if you want a more updated one.

Linux:

`apt install git-all`, `pacman -S git`.

## Using:

There are commands (in order):
- clone
- add
- commit
- push
- pull
  - merge conflicts
- reset
