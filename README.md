# Git Workshop

This is a quick demo on basic git usage.

# Why Git?

When you have a big project, people end up with different versions and it
is hard to maintain concurrently.

People had ideas - SVN and CVS, but Linus was unhappy... so he disappeared
for 2 weeks and came back with `git`.

# How Git

There are commands (in order):
- clone
- add
- commit
- push
- pull
- reset
